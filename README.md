# Geotechnical - Mining Engineering Python Code

The purpose of this github repository is to post Geotechnical/Mining Engineering related python scripts written in Python 3.3. Code was created during Master's Degree research by Joaquin Roibal at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 2014-2016 and is for research/academic purposes only. All code licensed under MIT License, must provide attribution for any further derivative works. This repository is kept in order to provide a history of the development of this code, however, a more concise version is available on another github repository.
