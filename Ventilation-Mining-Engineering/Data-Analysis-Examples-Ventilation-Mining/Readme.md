**Data Analysis of New Method of Ventilation Surveying in Underground Mining**

***Methodology***

A small, consumer grade micro-computer is equipped with a battery pack, sensor unit, case, and python script to collect temperature, pressure, and relative humidity every three minutes and save these values to a csv file which can be accessed and analyzed using computer desktop spreadsheet software. These values are then recorded with the date and time of measurement, and two or more can be used to collect data inside an operating underground mine. The data recorded by this methodology can then be used to analyze areas of interest within the mine and can provide more accurate insights for computer modelling of ventilation network.  All python code used for collection and analysis used in this methodology is available through an online publically accessible repository.

The purpose of this file folder is to organize the Data Analysis portion of the Ventilation in Mining Engineering Data Collection modules.

***Data Analysis***

Two Raspberry Pi Sense Hat Data Collection Units were set to measure data during a ventilation surveying measurement in an underground mining operation. These measurements were taken during two days, with Temperature, Humidity and Pressure recorded once every three minutes for each unit. Simultaneously, approximately 42 measurements were taken manually of Temperature (Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb), Relative Humidity, Air Speed and Airway sizing.
